# Dev Diary

## 16/08/22
First day. Configured project and already some questions (Will I make many gradle modules?)

## 17/08/22
Began from data source. Some retrofit. Copy pasted some old code that worked with...coroutines, not flow!

## 18/08/22
Worked on retrofit and flow. Found some nice medium article. Created Bibliography and almost overengineered the app with a Flow to monitor internet connection status

## 22/08/22
Added Hilt and...project cannot compile. Seems to have some incompatibility between Compose Compiler and/or gradle and/or kotlin version. Tried "random" values (and look at how it was made on an recent project) to make it work!

## 23/08/22
Repository created and "ok" to create the Flooooooow (so much preparation before the fun)

## 24/08/22
Flow works (with logs). Preparing Room for caching

## 25/08/22
Caching works with Room. Next Step: Compose!

## 26/08/22
And Compose basically works (displaying title). Having the feeling that once bases are here (a good repository for example), things go faster

## 29/08/22
Included Coil (so we can display movie posters) in few lines and....what? 10 minutes? ðŸ˜¯. And fought with colors for 1 hour...ðŸ¤·

## 30/08/22
What have I done? I wasn't satisfied by the way I processed the TMDB APi response. It was the movie list if ok and an empty list if not. Now I have a complex system of sealed class to  process success or failure and trace the reason (no internet, exception etc...).

## 30/08/22
What have I done? (bis) Ok I had to save some meta data (the current source data for movies: Internet or cache for example). And If I try Proto dataSource?

## 02/08/22
Yes no log from yesterday. What have I done? (ter) There is so boiler plates code for using proto Datasource. So much work for "just" save some data...

## 05/08/22
And the cache with both room and datasource works (basically)?. Just forgot to fully implement timestamp for last successful connection  

## 07/08/22
(no code yesterday) Fully implement timestamp for last successful connection ! No I have to display it on homeScreen   

## 08/08/22
Worked yesterday and today on displaying data on the screen with compose. Miss `dimens.xml` badly
