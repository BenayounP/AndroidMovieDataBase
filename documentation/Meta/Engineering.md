# Engineering

## There is no simple app
Even with the simplest business need "get the popular movies and displays it" there is no simplest engineering. You ALWAYS have to make decisions. 
I explain here my choices. 

## Global philosophy

### Do it like Google

### Do it like a real project

## How I did it from scratch

### Some thought
This "simple" app needed many research, a lot of back and forth and so would have been very difficult to do in the classic way: "here's your Jira ticket, see you tomorrow for next step"

### Step1: create architecture skeleton

### Step2: just a log with a movie title

### Step3: "just" complete layers walktrough with log

### Step 4: Display moviiiiies

### Step 5 : improve system
* add metadata about movie update
* add gradle modules


## Some choices I had to take
### UI
#### Compose
* I had to create Dimensions class to handle global dimensions (padding1, Padding2)
* I had to create Color class to handle global colors with light and dark theme

## Some thought

### This simple app took more than one month!
One week "just" for create the skeleton architecture

### Compose is great but the paint is still wet

### Flow works like a charm (if you don't test it)

### My work was essentially to create ans uses classes
In another words I didn't do any low level algorithms/kotlin language. I didn't need to optimize some sorting algorithm but fight with the many variations of Flow. 

## How I implemented some principles

### DDD

### SOLID
