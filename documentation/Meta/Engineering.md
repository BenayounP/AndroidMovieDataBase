# Engineering

## There is no simple app
Even with the simplest business need "get the popular movies and displays it" there is no simplest engineering. You ALWAYS have to make decisions.

## Global philosophy

### Do it like Google

### Do it like a real medium project

### If you don't know how to do it, try to create reusable code
