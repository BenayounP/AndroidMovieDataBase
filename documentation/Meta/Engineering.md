# Engineering

## There is no simple app
Even with the simplest business need "get the popular movies and displays it" there is no simplest engineering. You ALWAYS have to make decisions. 
I explain here my choices. 

## Global philosophy

### Do it like Google

### Do it like a real project

## How I did it from scratch

### Step1: create architecture skeleton

### Step2: just a log with a movie title

### Step3: just a complete layers walktrough with log

### Step 4: Display moviiiiies

### Step 5 : improve system
* add metadata about movie update
* add gradle modules


## Some choices I had to take

### UI
#### Compose
* I had to create Dimensions class to handle global dimensions (padding1, Padding2)
* I had to create Color class to handle global colors with light and dark theme
