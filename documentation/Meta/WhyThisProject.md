# About this project

## What's that app? 
This is a very simple from a business perspective. it's just fetching data and save them in case the device is offline. 

But I tried to make it the most perfect in term of computer engineering :
* Use Google recommended architecture
* Use recommended patterns like [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
* Use Google latest libraries
* With a real Test policy (local and instrumented)
* With some CI

## But why?
### For me 
* be updated and..
* have an updated "book" on github

### For the community
There is many simple projects about architecture OR Compose (for example) or Room but no simple projects which makes them work together.

My objective is to create one that hleps you understand how they work together and to use it at a template.  

## Who Am I (TLDR)
* Computer Engineer since 20 years
* Android developer since 11 years
* French Living in Bordeaux (best üç∑ in the world)
