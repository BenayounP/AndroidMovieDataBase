# About this project

## What's that app? 
This is a very simple application from a business perspective. it's just fetching data and save them in case the device is offline. 

But I tried to make it the most perfect in term of computer engineering :
* Use Google recommended architecture
* Use recommended patterns like [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles
* Use Google latest libraries
* Set up a real Test policy (local and instrumented)

## But why?
### For me 
* Learn/update myself on how to use and wire each parts of Android development
* Have an updated "book" on github

### For the community

You can find a bazilion of tutorials, post, codelabs or projects for each part of Android
development.

You can also have a real complex app from Google team that do
that: [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).

But...it's a complex project with 21 Gradle modules.

So my objective is to create the simplest project that helps you understand how they work together
and to use it at a template.
